## Build Instructions
MacAssistant is built using Swift 4.2 and Xcode 10

### Get OAuth Credentials
You will need OAuth credentials from the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com). 
- Create a new project in the Google Developer Console
- Enable the Google Assistant API for that project
- Generate an OAuth credential
    - Select the application type of `Other UI`
    - State that you will be using `User Data`
    - Download the JSON file
    - Rename the file to `google_oauth.json`
    - Place it in your project at `./MacAssistant/Config/google_oauth.json`

### Building MacAssistant
- Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/vanshg/MacAssistant.git`
- Open the `MacAssistant.xcworkspace` file (not `xcproject`) in Xcode
- Make sure you've obtained the OAuth Credentials as defined above
- Hit the Play button on the top left

### Updating the Assistant SDK Version 
- If you would like to contribute *and* the Assistant SDK version needs to be updated, clone the repository with the `--recursive` option
- Update `VERSION` found at the top of the `gen_swift_proto.sh` as necessary
- Run `./gen_swfit_proto.sh`
    - This will build the `grpc-swift` module, and then generate the appropriate Swift files from the `.proto` definitions found in the `googleapis` submodule
